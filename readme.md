## Synopsis

Your Average Redditor (yar) is a small python script for scraping, and imitating, a subreddit.

## Code Example

```bash
#A Basic test
yar.py -io learnpython
```

```bash
#changing defaults
yar.py -io dwarffortress --pages 40 --comments 4

#output
Just think - it's not DF - it's definitely the agents or how and cage traps.
Explorers - The Tombs It became necessary to trade with except for places you don't put a hotel in hell.
Oh wait, I think I'm too busy with school right now it's to reduce lag.
Some witnesses say that your fortress is seeming to get easier once you get dragons?
```

## Dependencies

numpy, beautifulsoup, argparse

## Motivation

Reddit comments seem very derivative, so I wanted to create a script that would mimic that process.
It is also a nice excuse to learn beautifulsoup.
