## Synopsis

Your Average Redditor (yar) is a small python script for scraping, and imitating, a subreddit.

## Code Example

```bash
#A Basic test
yar.py -io --subreddit learnpython

#output
"Only a couple of personal stuff, small helper utilities for my first app."
```


## Motivation

Reddit comments seem very derivative, so I wanted to create a script that would mimic that process. I also wanted to learn beautifulsoup!
