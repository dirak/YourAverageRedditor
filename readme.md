## Synopsis

Your Average Redditor (yar) is a small python script for scraping, and imitating, a subreddit.

## Code Example

```bash
#A Basic test
yar.py -io learnpython

#Changing the defaults
yar.py -io learnpython --pages 30 --comments 50
```

## Dependencies

numpy, beautifulsoup, argparse

## Motivation

Reddit comments seem very derivative, so I wanted to create a script that would mimic that process.
It is also a nice excuse to learn beautifulsoup.
